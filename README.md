Predict survival on the Titanic
## Part 1 Visualization :art:
First of all I decided to watch how gender and age affect the likelihood of survival

You know if you are a young girl of 20-25 years old you are very lucky.

Just look at these percentages and understand being a woman at that moment was the best decision in their life.

Here's another proof

The second step was to understand how the number of relatives on board affects the chance of your survival

It will help in the next part when I'll do some feature engineering.
Such as creating Name Title,Cabin Letter, Age Bins ... columns
